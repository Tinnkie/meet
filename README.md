# MEET [Serverless Progressive Web Application with React and TDD]

### This is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React using a test-driven development (TDD) approach. The app fetches upcoming events using the Google Calendar API and displays them in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

<br>

## Objective

### The goal of this project is to build a web application that combines the benefits of serverless architecture and PWAs. By using serverless functions, the app requires no backend maintenance, is easy to scale, always available, and has no cost for idle time. The PWA features allow for instant loading, offline support, push notifications, "add to home screen" prompt, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility. To ensure high-quality code, the app is built using a TDD approach where tests are written before writing the actual functionality for the app. Additionally, the app incorporates data visualization techniques to display event data in an understandable and engaging format.

## User Stories:

1. As a user, I should be able to filter events by city, so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city;
2. As a user, I should be able to expand and collapse an event's details, so that I can quickly see the information I need;

4. As a user, I should be able to use the app even when I don't have internet access, so that I can still access the information I need even when I'm not connected to the internet;
5. As a user, I should be able to see a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city, so that I can quickly identify which cities have more events and plan my activities accordingly.
